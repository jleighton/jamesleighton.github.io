So nearly a week has passed with energy drinks! I did have Lucozade Cola at lunch today which apparently contained 0.012% caffeine or some small amount but I'm not going to count that. I didn't have a red bull or monster, relentless or rockstar! Pretty proud of myself! I'm actually pretty tired now which is nice, time to go read a book (A Game of Thrones!) or play a game (Dragon Quest IX!) before I crash.

I even got a free thermos (it's red by the way!) at work today, neato. I filled it with ice water for bed not coffee... don't worry.
