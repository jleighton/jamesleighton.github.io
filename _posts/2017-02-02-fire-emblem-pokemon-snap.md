What does Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright & Pokémon Snap have in common? I completed them both last week!

Two more games off the backlog! The girlfriend and I played Pokemon Snap to the credits in one sitting, and I completed [FE Fates Birthright](http://amzn.to/2l7UOwo) on super easy n00b mode.

Whatever... I am not ashamed, I was totally just playing for the story! Plus, I don't have time for long-ass RPGs any more. So, having a way to breeze through the story was nice. Maybe one day I'll go back and play Conquest & Revelations. Probably not though... A snippet of my RPG backlog includes highlights such as [Dragon Quest 7](https://jamesleighton.com/2016/11/13/dragon-quest-vii-is-too-long-buts-its-ok/), several Final Fantasy Tactics games, several Disgaea games, Skyrim, Morrowind, Witcher 3... you get the idea....

I enjoyed playing Fates on super-scrub mode, but I won't be going back any time soon.

Pokémon Snap was an awesome game. I genuinely don't know why we didn't play it sooner. We got to the credits in about 4 hours and caught about 95% of the Pokémon in the game. Thoughts include: 'WHY HASN'T NINTENDO MADE POKEMON SNAP 2!!!!!!', and 'FUCK YOU OAK! THAT PHOTO WAS AMAZING'. Great game!

I also discovered that two players can use different controllers but still control player 1 on the WiiU Virtual Console. This meant the gf could have the gamepad and I had a pro controller, and we didn't need to keep passing the controller. Something small, but pretty neat.
