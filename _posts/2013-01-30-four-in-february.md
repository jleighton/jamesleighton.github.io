I like the idea of 'Four in February'. Complete four video games during the 2nd month of the year. It sounds like a fun challenge, and should get me 25% closer to my goals for 2013.

The games I'll aim to complete are:  
*Pok√©mon Black Version 2  
* LEGO Lord of the Rings  
*Half Life 1  
* Elder Scrolls: Oblivion (Only the main quest, which I've never managed to complete without being distracted!)

None of these will be completed to 100%, rather just the main bulk of the story done and the credits rolling; this is now how I judge a game complete. I don't have enough spare time to 100% anything any more...
