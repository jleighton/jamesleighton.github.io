I decided to move my main PC at home to Linux last weekend and have been pretty pleasantly surprised at how far desktop Linux has moved on since I last tried a few years back.  

I went for [Ubuntu 20.04][4] because I am lazy, and decided that was probably the course of least resistance. I was right (mostly!), and I will write some blog posts detailing what worked well, and what needed tweaks/changes.

The installer managed to install the proprietary Nvidia drivers with no fuss. Holy crap, I remember spending days getting graphics cards working back in the day.

Steam now has a compatibility layer called [Proton][2], so I got that installed. I still need to spend some more time in Windows games, but looking through the Proton page, it looks good.

Native Linux games such Civ 5, Left 4 Dead 2 ran exactly how I would expect them to for my system (Intel Core i5-2320 CPU @ 3.00GHz, & GeForce GTX 970).

I played a bit of Age of Empires 2, and that worked fine. Since I don't play PC games made after around 2015, I think I will be fine.
