I finally finished [The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Anniversary Edition](http://zelda.com/fourswordsanniversary/ "The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Anniversary Edition") for Nintendo 3DS this week. I've been trying to play it at my local [Streetpass](http://www.streetpassnorthwales.co.uk/ "StreetPass North Wales") events for nearly a year, but we always get distracted by the event or no-one wants to play it/has it downloaded to their console.

But this time was different! We set up an event purely for the purposes of completing Four Swords, and we accomplished our goal. We even finished the retro themed Realms of Memories stages which are based on Legend of Zelda from the NES, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. They were awesome reminders of the games and evoked some memories of those that I've actually played.

A fun fact about Four Swords: it was the first appearance of what was the become the concept for the Minish Cap. Known as the [Gnat Hat](http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Gnat_Hat "Gnat Hat") it allowed players to shrink to a fraction of their usual size. In the Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap the same thing occurs via [Ezlo](http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Ezlo)

I thoroughly enjoyed playing through Four Swords at the pub. The atmosphere was great, and maybe more than once we threw each other into lava or onto spikes. It's seriously good fun, and it's a shame that was a time limited download both in Europe years ago, and the US back in January 2014. I wonder why they don't just charge Â£5 for it and let people give them money? Oh, Nintendo you so crazy!

We'll probably have to get together at some point to 100% it, since the last thing left to do is the Hero's Trials which are (obviously) more difficult stages meant to test you and your friends. Perhaps we'll do that one day.

Until then, that's one off of the backlog! Success. What next? Phoenix Wright Dual Destinies and Terraria for PC!
