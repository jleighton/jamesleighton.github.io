Sorry, I don't want to write about all these games that I played! A few short mentions:

- 51 Worldwide Games is awesome for local co-op play... Ludo is fun, Blackjack is great, and Toy Baseball is just ridiculous.
- Prison Architect's campaign was short but excellent. I should probably try build some more prisons!
- Download the Mobile to PC mod pack for GTA VC. It looks fucking fantastic running at 4k60fps!
