I really need to try and complete this post a bit more often!

### Games Completed in 2019: ###

I haven't really completed much this year. I've not had the focus to really knuckle down on my longer games, and  most of my shorter games aren't the sort that you can 'complete' in any meaningful way. Hopefully I should get some more time soon whilst I am travelling to really sink my teeth into some of my Switch backlog.

1. Mario Bros. (Switch)
2. Rune Factory 4 (3DS)
3. Captain Toad Treasure Tracker (Switch)

### Games I am playing now & next ###

I got Mario Maker 2 yesterday, which I think will become my new 'go-to game' when I don't want to play anything else. This title currently belongs to POWGI Wordsearch which is just relaxing and helps me de-stress. I picked up Terraria on switch recently too, but I haven't been able to get to grips with the controls. Maybe if I spend some more with it they'll 'click'.

Coming up next on my backlist to complete includes Wargroove, South Park Stick of Truth, and eventually getting through Skyrim AND Breath of The Wild. I really need to complete 2 or 3 games before September when Dragon Quest XI comes out!
