I really want to love [Dragon Quest VII](http://amzn.to/2gcpTx4), but I don't have the time right now to do it justice and it upsets me. I've finished Dragon Quest IV & V for the 3DS and I jumped head first into this one when it came out in September because it seemed right up my alley.

I'm lucky if I get 7-10 hours a week to play, so I played quite a bit for a few weeks then made a fatal mistake. I got busy and put the game down.

Going back to it, I can see this is a quintessential JRPG from an age when longer meant better. Unfortunately, my play style doesn't match this anymore... It seems I prefer shorter RPGs, puzzle games, and racing games these days. I guess this matches the time I can invest into games!

There hasn't been an story arc I haven't liked so far. It's just that I'm only a third into the game... I picked it up and played another two or so islands for a few hours, then I had to go hunting for my tablets to progress even though I'd finished the story for those islands.

Such a great game deserves to be beaten so it's going back on the shelf until I have some time to focus on it (when there are less games on my backlog.)

Oh to be a teenager again!
