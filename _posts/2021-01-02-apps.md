# [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/)

In the last year, I moved my personal stuff away from Gmail and Google Calendar (see Fastmail below) so it felt fitting to try a life without Chrome as well. Firefox is not as fast as Chrome, but it more than does everything I need it to. Plus, it helps with stopping the google monopoly of the web.

# [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/)

I used to use Notion, but didn't use the advanced features like the inbuilt database tools enough to justify the cost. Joplin is a free (open source) markdown note taking application that I am using to write this post. It can sync via a variety of backends; I use the S3 backend with backblaze but it also supports Dropbox, Onedrive, Webdav and just using a file system.

It's great. I can't recommend it enough, and I am really looking forward to seeing what the new plugin interface allows people to create.

# [Backblaze](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/0096qv)

Complete PC backup + S3 compatible storage service for an affordable price.

I use the S3 compatible bucket storage for rclone on my servers, as well as a bucket for Joplin notes. This costs me about $0.40 a month, the PC backup is US$6/month and worth it for the peace of mind.

# [Rambox CE](https://rambox.pro/#ce)

Container for web apps - saves having a ton of tabs open in my browser. I use it for my email, kanban boards, my gaming dashboards (grafana), whatsapp web, and my home temperature monitoring dashboard.

# [Exist](https://exist.io/?referred_by=jamesleighton)

![dfe77989dde9038b1a6dc5734f0992c5.png](/images/994f87f5526647a99c71e140b3c7732f.png){:class="img-fluid" :alt="Exist Dashboard"}

'life tracking' / 'qualitative self' - This lets me collate all the data I generate: time gaming, time sleeping, productivity, tasks completed, sunrise and sunset among loads of other stuff and produces interesting and useful reports about the correlations between these.

# [Kanboard](https://kanboard.org/)

![ec36f03ed264d75375531e459c3c18e4.png](/images/48ebba9dd39548f8a8fb3f38ff866b46.png){:class="img-fluid" :alt="Kanboard"}

Self Hosted Trello. Nothing else to say, if you use Kanban boards and don't want to use a service like Trello, you can't go far wrong with Kanboard. Simple and easy to host, lightweight, and mobile friendly as well.

# [Pi Hole](https://pi-hole.net/)

Block all the ads! I will be sad when DNS over HTTPS takes over, and this method of ad blocking is rendered useless. For now though, it is 100% the best way to protect your network from ads and other forms of malware.

# [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/uk/)

Apple music still doesn't really support [Last.fm](http://Last.fm) therefore I will continue to use Spotify for the foreseeable future. Maybe one day this will change.

# [Fastmail](https://ref.fm/u23751568)

![2a7a7fe0b69d564b3d6e9fe0eefd8f3a.png](/images/c2b52c4aa3374459a353237553636463.png){:class="img-fluid" :alt="Fastmail Logo"}

Not cheap, but reliable. If you want to move your email away from Google, [save 10% and use my link](https://ref.fm/u23751568). I find the web interface simpler and faster than Gmail and the app is nicer too.
