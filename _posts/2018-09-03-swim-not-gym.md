I tried the gym. I hate the gym. I keep trying, but it’s always awful.

This time, I joined the local leisure centre. This is better. The pool brings back nostalgia from my childhood. I used to be a pretty decent swimmer when I was
a kid. Not so much anymore, but it’s a nice memory.

The first time my wife and I went swimming sucked. I managed ten 25 metre lengths. We went again the next day and I managed an extra two lengths. But I was
enjoying it.

I suck at breathing and swimming (a potentially deadly combination!) but on the third visit I managed 22 lengths! I’m feeling motivated to continue and I think
I can feel the benefits already.

I’ll let you know how I’m feeling after the first month. I think we’ll stick with it this time.
