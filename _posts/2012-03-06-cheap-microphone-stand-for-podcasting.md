Yeah, I realise there is probably a million things wrong with this, but hey... We're poor and can't afford a proper stand at the minute. So this will have to do. We're going to record episode 3 of our podcast this week, which you can find and subscribe over at [www.theunnamedpodcast.co.uk](http://www.theunnamedpodcast.co.uk "The Unnamed Podcast")!
