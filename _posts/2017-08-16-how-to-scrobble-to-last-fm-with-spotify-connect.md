June 2018 Update
----------------

Last.fm now natively supports scrobbling from Spotify Connect. The Listenz service has now been discontinue.

To enable this, head to your Last.fm account settings and open the Applications tab. Connect to Spotify here (Spotify Scrobbling) and you'll be good to Scrobble from Android Auto, Bose Soundtouch, PS4 and other Spotify connect applications.

It's pretty much impossible to scrobble songs you listen to via Spotify Connect via the standard spotify apps. However, recently Spotify released an updated API that allows the retrieval of the currently playing track. Some kind soul has therefore made the ~~'[Spotify Scrobbler](https://spotifyscrobbler.com/)' ~~[Listenz](https://liste.nz/) (they had to change the name to avoid the spotify trademark, apparently.)

This means you can now track your plays from the PS4, and other devices that utilise Spotify Connect such as the Bose Soundtouch speaker range. Fantastic! It also means you can disable the unreliable scrobbling from each Spotify app you use as they break at least once a week for seemingly no reason. Super fantastic.
