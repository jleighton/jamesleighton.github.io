There is a simple way to duplicate any item that is stackable by using the streetpass functionality built into Fantasy Life for Nintendo 3DS.

Fantasy Life's Streetpass revolves around choosing an item you wish to give to passers-by. However, it does not take the item from you....

It's been found that you can choose multiples of an item to give away. Let's start low... how about a stack of gold ore? Well now you and your friend has that stack of gold ore. I'm sure you can see where this is going! How about some Life Cures? They'll come in handy no doubt. [Rare ores](http://reveriaexplorer.com/items/652) like magic or, marine ore, maybe something from the DLC (which I've yet to bother buying) are all pretty good ideas. Mine or buy a stack of 99 of them, and voila. You'll soon have 198 or them.

See what your friends want, and tell them what you want and you can be rich together!
