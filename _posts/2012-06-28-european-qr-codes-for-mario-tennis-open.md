Go to the file selection screen in game, and press Up+Start. The QR code scanner will open; then just scan any of the following! 

These should work for the UK, Europe and Australia. As more QR codes are released, I will post them here so be sure to check soon at some point. If you don't already own [Mario Tennis Open](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B007EMRJ8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=geekyjames-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B007EMRJ8I) why not buy a copy today?
