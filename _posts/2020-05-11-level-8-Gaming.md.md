This week the outline for this post was built by my InfluxDB powered twitter bot and automatically saved into Notion! Handy.

## Final Fantasy Tactics A2 (DS)

*5h45m this week, 11h32m total*

Determined to tackle my backlog during the lockdown, I had a look through my DS games and decided to give Final Fantasy Tactics A2 another go. 

One of the pinnacles of turn based games in my opinion. The battles are 15-20 minutes long and always feel fair. The law system seems to add some challenge but I’m not sure if the restrictions are randomised or not; time will tell!

I’ll definitely be playing this some more over the coming weeks and months.

## Animal Crossing: New Horizons (Switch)

*1h45m this week, 52h15m total*

Honestly, I’m burning out on New Horizons. It’s awesome, and I enjoyed the time I spent on my island immensely but... it’s lacking something....

I miss going to the island with my wife. We spent countless evenings back at uni going on island tours. I hope they bring that back.  The random islands are crap.

Talking to my villagers, watering flowers, and tending to fruit trees has lost its shine. 

## Super Nintendo Entertainment System - Nintendo Swi… (Switch)

*0h45m this week, 15h50m total*

Last week one of my friends finally got Nintendo Switch online, so we had some fun with the SNES version of Mario Kart, and found out just how bad we are in Super Mario World. More practice required!
