I had a realisation this week that I should spend more time outside of work doing things to improve myself. I'm on track with my diet (mostly), I'm trying to cut back on sugars and (especially) sweeteners, so why not do something that stretches my brains in the evenings.

I have enough games in my backlog that I could probably play every game to completion and still not beat them all before I retire so that's kind of low priority, I just need to stop buying new fucking games. Hmm. Looking at you, Lumines Remastered. And N++. And Smash Bros.  And the stupid fucking Snes Mini sat on my desk.

Anyway, I was pretty nifty with Python about ten years ago so why not jump back in. I vaguely remember working on an IRC bot for the channel I used to mod back in the day!

I found this list of [mini projects](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/06/05/five-mini-programming-projects-for-the-python-beginner/) which I am going to work through and blog about as I get through them.

1.  Dice Rolling Sim
2.  Guess the Number
3.  Mad Libs
4.  Text Adventure Game
5.  Hangman

I spent an evening this week setting up a Linux virtual machine to keep my environment consistent no matter what computer I am using (VirtualBox + Ubuntu 18.04) and revived my old BitBucket account (because I like the ability to set a repository to private) then spent an evening learning Git whilst cobbling together two versions of the dice sim. I'll make a separate post about that soon.
