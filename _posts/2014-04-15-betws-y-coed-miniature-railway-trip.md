At [Betws-Y-Coed station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betws-y-Coed_railway_station "Betws-Y-Coed Station Wikipedia Article"), there is a railway museum and miniature railway. The museum entry fee was Â£1.50, and so were tickets on the miniature railway. Having nearly run out of pennies, we decided to hop on the miniature railway, as you do. We even got cute little tickets which the driver checked...

Only when the train started and a family with young children walked onto the platform did we realise that this probably looked a bit strange: Two 24 year old guys, and a 19 year old girl sat in the tiny carriages. Of course, we were the only people actually on the train.

The train itself was coal fired, and we had to wait for coal to be loaded before we were on our miniature way around the one mile long track. We passed the previously mentioned family about three times, since the track double back and looped on itself as seen in the background of the next photo. It was amusing, to say the least!

After we looked around Betws-Y-Coed itself and determined that we couldn't afford anything here we continued along the A5 into Bangor stopping along the way to take some more photographs and to look at hills and waterfalls. It was a great end to a busy weekend trekking around North Wales looking at RNLI stations including Beaumaris, Porthdinllaen, Abersoch, Pwllheli, Criccieth, Llandudno and Conwy (which [Laurence](http://andrews.io/?page_id=115) will be posting about on his blog 'soon'!)

Once I get hold of them, I'll add some more photos to this post!
