Replaced an old wireless access point with an [Apple AirPort Express](http://www.apple.com/uk/airportexpress/) this week. It’s pretty neat, the best part being wireless speakers connected to any iPod touch or iPhone in the house. Wherever you are! Also, my wireless actually works now which is also a benefit.

The Express plugs directly into any stereo system and will play music from any iTunes library or iDevice. There is even software available that will let you redirect sound from an application (such as Spotify) to the Airport. [Spotify](www.spotify.com) in the living room! Now that is useful.

It can function as an access point, like I currently have it set up or it can connect to an existing network allowing you to connect it to a remote speaker system in a bedroom or garage for example. Apparently you can extend network range too, but I haven’t looked into that yet.

[Airfoil](http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/) is the program I played with to redirectsound from a Windows PC. Available for Mac and Windows. It has a trial mode limited to ten minutes, but it definitely works with Spotify and probably a few other programs. Grooveshark, maybe?

Probably the best bit of wireless kit I’ve ever purchased!
