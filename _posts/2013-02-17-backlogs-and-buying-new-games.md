Backlogs and Buying New Games....  Damn, I really want [Persona 4 Golden](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B009RH725S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B009RH725S&linkCode=as2&tag=trrxf-21)... but honestly will I get time to play it? Ignoring Four in February I have so much still to play (that I do really want to get around to at some point! Backlogs are a bad thing for motivation to play games. Here are just some of my outstanding games....  
* Professor Layton series on DS  
* Dragon Quest 4/5/6 remakes on DS  
* Retro City Rampage on Vita  
* The various Grand Theft Auto games for PSP/DS/PC  
* Chono Trigger  
* The various Mario games for 3DS that are in differ stages of completion  
* All the Zelda games I own (between Virtual Console, DS, and 3DS.. Link's Awakening, Minish Cap, Ocarina of Time, Tingle's Rupee Land)  
* Pokemon Conquest and Super Pokemon Rumble  
* Animal Crossing (Although one doesn't really 'complete' Animal Crossing!)  
* Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim  
* All of the Fallout games (without getting bored 4 hours in)  
* Just Cause 2  
* Cave Story and Mutant Mudds  
* Faster than Light  
* Various Paradox Strategy games (although they are apparently very time consuming)  
* Leisure Suit Larry series (Damn you, GOG)  
* Orcs Must Die  
* The Walking Dead  
* The Stalker Series  
* Half Life series  
* The various tycoon games from GOG that I have amassed.  
* Baldur's Gate and the remaining D&D games (once again from GOG)

Clearly there is a problem here. I simply do not need any more games... I think I should aim to finish 3/5 games from my backlog before I buy new ones. So therefore I won't be buying any more (Animal Crossing New Leaf is exempt from this clause) until I finish at least 5 games from my backlog. Four in February should see me completing two of these (Half Life and Oblivion) and we'll see what goes on after then!

Wish me luck!
