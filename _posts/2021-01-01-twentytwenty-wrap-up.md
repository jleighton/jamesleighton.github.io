2020 has been a strange here. Here is how I spent some of it:

# Games

I played 66 games for longer than half an hour in 2020 and played at least a few seconds of 109 games in total. Out of my top 9 games, only 1 was released in 2020.

Of my top 66 games, I played each for an average of 6h12m (drastically dragged higher by animal crossing)

1.  **Animal Crossing New Horizons** (78h55m) - I played every few days from March to early October when my save got corrupted and Nintendo refused to let me download the cloud backup. I had a great time, but I can't face going back and starting a new island yet.
2.  **Dragon Quest XI** **S** (29h10m) - I got this game for Christmas 2019 and completed it mere days before Animal Crossing monopolised my gaming time. An awesome game. I still need to go back and finish the Tockington Shrines, as well as the post game Act 3.
3.  **Forza Horizon 4** (16h03m) - A late contender, I upgraded my PC in November and subscribed to Xbox Game Pass for PC. Forza Horizon 4 is the ultimate chill racing game - Wanna drive fast? Hit the speed traps! Wanna get massive air? Go find the danger signs and jump off. I can lose hours at a time, and never feel bored. I think this will be making an appearance on this list again in twelve months time.

Games that missed the top 9 include Open TTD, Digimon Cyber Sleuth, Fantasy Life, Super Mario 3D All-Stars, Train Simulator. Perhaps they'll make an appearance next year.

# Movies & TV

During Lockdown #1, we watched the Marvel Cinematic Universe in release order from Iron Man to Avenger's End Game. I'd previously watched a handful of the films, but watching them all back to back over 4 weeks was pretty special. I thoroughly recommend getting yourself sat in front of Disney+ and watch these films on a schedule for the next month. Or three.

I also rewatched Bojack Horseman, Anthony Bourdain's amazing Parts Unknown and too many Studio Ghibli movies to remember. It was a pretty fantastic year for catching up on TV shows and Movies all things considered.
