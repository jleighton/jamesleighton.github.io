I still haven't really completed many games in 2017. I was going to avoid Super Mario Odyssey until I'd beaten Galaxy and Galaxy 2, but that didn't happen. (I got to the credits in Odyssey, though so that's OK. Maybe.)

I think NOW would be a good time to STOP buying games, for the last time. ;)

The romp through the story of Odyssey was great, and I definitely agree with the majority of reviews. The game is brilliant! I think it'll now take its place as a 15 minute game whenever the urge strikes, complete some more mini games, go find some more power moons...Â  The photo mode is really good, btw...

Odyssey's story took about 12 hours, over 3 gaming sessions. It pretty much consumed me last week.

On the Switch front, I also got myself heartily addicted to Stardew Valley in the last month. Welp, this game does 'one more day' perfectly. 25 hours later, and I am just about to start Year 2.

I really need to play some of my 'other' switch games such as Disgaea 5, and I am Setsuna... but I think November might be the month of short 3DS games from my backlog. I am pretty close to beating (the first half, anyway) of Pokemon Silver.

Maybe I won't take the Switch with me on my travels this month....

The current 'to play list'...

-   Stardew Valley (Switch)
-   Pokemon Silver (3DS Virtual Console)
-   Pullblox (3DS Download)
-   Super Mario Galaxy (Wii)
