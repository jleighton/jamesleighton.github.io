It's been a while since I last updated with a new post. Since then I've been using Crunchbang Linux as my main operating system, visited the Top of the Shard, bought a cheap netbook to carry around with me at uni so I don't have to spend ages looking for a computer when I (rarely, albeit) need one. I've also sold off quite a few of my old DS and PS3 games that although I wanted to play at some point the chances are that I never will. I even went for a bike ride last week...

Crunchbang is awesome. I'm currently using a Dell Mini 9 (Atrocious first gen intel atom, 1gb of memory) and yes it's a bit slow. The thing is I paid less than Â£90 for it. The battery is still fine, I most likely will update the memory soon but it just works! Chrome is perfectly useable, I can happily read the notes that I export from my smart pen (I can't however connect it directly. I have a Windows VM running on my desktop for that) and create my revision wiki and mind maps that I need to. It's actually a good thing that it doesn't play video very well. The only thing I've gotten to play is OpenTTD (again, a good thing).

Dell Mini 9 Netbook

Windows on this netbook would suck. It only has a 16gb SSD, and when it arrived from eBay with a fresh install of Windows 7 it had 3gb free space... Who thought that was a good idea?! I installed Crunchbang from a USB key and have been happy ever since. When I'm back at home I'll connect it to my local bridged network and run Synergy so I can share my desktop keyboard and mouse with the netbook on my desk.

We went to the Shard on Easter Sunday. Apparently we picked the best time and day possible. It was clear to the horizon when we went up at 10am, but started to get cloudly soon afterwards. Got some awesome pictures as seen below!
