Over a month has passed since my last post, and in that time I have been (slowly) working towards those goals I [mentioned](http://jamesleighton.com/2017/01/01/goals-and-motivation/).

I didn't go to the gym that much, but I have been doing exercises at home (and on the road) with the help of my girlfriend who does 30-60 minutes a day in our flat. I even have resistance bands, and a roller!

I have almost completely stopped drinking beer. In fact, I lost 8lbs which I am absolutely attributing to the lack ofÂ hoppy-malty goodness. I don't really even miss it that much... Which I thought I would! I have only had a single pint in three weeks.

I managed to log successfully for about a 14 day streak in MyfitnessPal before I went off that wagon. Anyway, onto the stats!

This is ***super motivational***, and should help me continue onwards and upwards!

This month I am going to the gym more often - at least twice a week when I am at home! Continue not drinking any/much at all beer. Continue with my Huel breakfast shakes (2 scoops, 300 calories), maybe extend these to lunchtimes\* with a bit more trial and error, and keep eating healthy meals for dinner.

You can make basically an infinite amount of omelette variations... Spinach, tuna, chicken, ham, turkey, broccoli, asparagus.. The list is basically endless :) Omelette's are awesome.

See you again for 'update 2' in March!

\*I tried this last week and failed absolutely miserably. I just couldn't deal with no having solid food for lunch. Maybe I should try again and take some healthy snacks into the office with me. Hmm!
